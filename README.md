# Viz.ai - AI used in Healthcare to improve outcomes
## Overview and Origin 
Name of company: Viz.ai 
Viz.ai was founded in 2016 by Dr. Chris Mansi, a neurosurgeon, and Dr. David Golan. 

The company is a result of the experiences of Dr. Mansi. One of his brain surgery patients, whose surgery was deemed successful, died due to the delay in getting her into the right care and the right treatment.  Frustrated by the factors contributing to the delay, Dr. Mansi and Dr. Golan envisioned using technology to address the delays - such as care coordination and delay in diagnostics and disease detection. 

## Funding 
Viz. ai received investment funding from more than 10 investment firms through multiple rounds of funding, including the last round, Series D in April of 2022. As of this research, the company has raised $253.45MM to date.  

They also generate revenue via sales to healthcare companies providing direct patient care, such as health systems and pharmaceutical companies in market development activities, including clinical trial recruitment. 

Viz.ai is valued at $1.2 B at this time. 

## Business Activities 

The business problems Viz.ai aims to solve vary with the specific setting of use. 
### Healthcare Delivery
In Healthcare delivery settings the technology is used for: 

Earlier detection of disease to enable access to care - such as detection of stroke, vascular pathologies, and genetic disorders such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy which is often misdiagnosed. Using diagnostic systems information, electronic health records, and other ancillary technology systems the AI can review disparate records and data, and enhance human review of images to identify possible pathologies. 

Improving and accelerating interdisciplinary communication between providers/specialties is facilitated based on the review and approval of the findings and recommendations by a human clinician. 

Minimizing incorrect pathway referrals and misdiagnosis saves not only patient lives and improves outcomes, but it can also lower overall costs through the reduction of unnecessary care due to missed diagnosis. 

Reduction of clinician fatigue and burnout is enabled through the use of Viz.ai to supplement the increased demand for radiologic and CT scans but a decrease in trained clinicians.  It also helps provide 24/7 support for the reading of these images as ER visits increase,  so do the demands on diagnostic departments and teams. 

Documentation and prompted follow-up of actionable incidental findings (AIFS) which while noted in the review of an exam by a radiologist, may not be tracked or acted upon, missing potential disease unrelated to the reason for the order. 
### Pharmaceutical/Medical Device Development
Pharmaceutical and medical device companies utilize the technology for research and identification of potential participants in clinical trials (precision targeting.)

## Landscape
Viz.ai operates in the healthcare and medical technology sector, with an emphasis on image-assisted disease identification and treatment selection. One example of this stroke diagnosis and treatment.

### Target Market and Market Size
Viz.ai's target customers include health systems, hospitals, and academic teaching centers focused on neurology (predominantly, stroke teams) vascular and cardiology specialties, and trauma centers which often are the gateway to the system.   

The global healthcare market size was valued at 11.2B USD in 2022 and is expected to reach 427.5B by 2032.

The North American market has dominated the AI healthcare space, generating over 6.5B USD in 2022. 

Other global markets, namely China and India, are expected to witness significant growth as technology advances and government support increases. 
### Competitors
Leading competitors in the larger healthcare AI space include Oncora, Koninklijke Philips N.V, Siemens, GE Healthcare, Medtronic, Google, Amazon, Intel, IBM, Johnson & Johnson Services, Inc., and Microsoft.  Companies already with a foothold in the diagnostic space may look to partner rather than build to keep their core competency as the focus of development.   

Smaller-sized niche competitors include Scry AI, Myst AI, Hushly, and Typeface to name a few.  However, none of these AI-specific companies holds the funding and revenue nor employee size advantage present with Viz.ai. 

Viz.ai holds a competitive advantage with the depth of AI capabilities serving as its core competency as compared to the diagnostics and device manufacturers. In addition, its deployment and presence in the market, along with key partnerships with academic and research facilities, such as the University of California San Francisco gives the company direct access to research and development in clinical practice algorithms and pathway development.   
 
### Trends and Innovations
Over the last 5-10 years, the field has seen significant advancements using technology, AI, and machine learning:   

Robot-Assisted Surgery: AI-driven robots assist surgeons in performing complex procedures with precision. 

Virtual Assistants: AI-powered virtual assistants help in administrative tasks and patient interactions. 

Clinical Trials: AI streamlines the clinical trial process, from patient recruitment to data analysis. 

Diagnosis: AI tools assist in the accurate and timely diagnosis of diseases. 

## Technologies 
Viz.ai employs artificial intelligence, deep learning, and computer vision technologies to analyze medical images, particularly CT scans. They use algorithms to identify potential strokes and notify healthcare professionals. 

Viz.ai builds on technologies to support its product delivery.  These technologies include file hosting services like AWS, CRM services for client support via Salesforce.com, Inc., Sumologic for log monitoring, getstream.io providing secure messaging, Twillio Sengrid, and FCM for messaging and routing services. Security technology includes the use of CarbonHeliz and IBMQradar.  They report they will be migrating to Coralogix for analysis of log data rather than continue with Sumologic. 

## Results
The business impact of Viz.ai includes improved patient outcomes, reduced time to treatment, and increased collaboration among healthcare professionals. Specific clinical performance and quality success metrics include the reduction in time from scan to treatment initiation and improved patient recovery rates. Business results expected an estimated 5% to 10% savings in healthcare spending (roughly $200 to $360B yearly).   

Viz.ai reports positive business results in terms of revenues, increased revenue per employee, and continued growth of the company. Current estimates for the privately held companyâ€™s revenue is $169.7M per year.  Estimated revenue per employee is $413,966 with a 410-employee base. 

## Recommendations 
Viz.ai should continue expanding its AI-driven diagnostic capabilities to other medical conditions that are detected using radiologic and other image-based diagnostics.  

If not present already, a telemedicine platform for real-time consultations with specialists for neurologic, vascular, and cardiomyopathy diagnosis and treatment. 

Beyond disease diagnosis, the company could also look at supplying adjacent services to support clinicians in how to communicate, discuss, and support patients receiving life-changing diagnoses.   

Viz.ai should also consider ways to educate the provider community on artificial intelligence to help lessen the fear of the unknown and worry concerning the use of AI. Unaddressed concerns exacerbate the slow adoption of technology by clinicians - currently a barrier to the growth of the use of AI in healthcare. 

Viz.ai can take a leadership role in addressing barriers based on the accuracy, breadth, and standardization of data used in healthcare technology.   Leading on the topic of removing bias from data sets and overall clinical research will improve the representation of various communities and patients in the data sets used to create treatment pathways. 

Regulatory clarity is needed as well and while the FDA has approved 91 additional AI and ML tools in 2022 alone, additional guidance and efforts to remove regulatory barriers will aid the expansion of the use of AI in healthcare. 

The technologies appropriate for these solutions would include AI, machine learning, and telemedicine platforms. Natural Language Processing and other tools used by coaching and telemedicine services would support these expansions.
